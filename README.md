# Fake_True_news_detection

Dataset obtained from : https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset  

Description and analysis: Model chosen is SVM classifier because it is best suited for clustered topical news data hence support vectors genrated with rbf or any wavelet based kernel will serve better. 
Inside the well commented script you will find a step by step approach for data cleaning , model selection and complete script.  

Template used here is available in my other repositories.

Additionally: Trying with naaive bayes classifier is much quicker(5 minutes) . Used a reference to get the model running then switched models to get better prediction. 
Alternate approaches :
Using CNN/ANN to make a better prediction model. as deep learning is incorporated. Expected model will be more robust. 

Time taken to train in cpu: <3 hours.
